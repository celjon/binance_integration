"""
Tasks module for background processing.

This module can be used for defining Celery tasks or other asynchronous jobs,
particularly for data aggregation, cleanup, or notifications.

Currently empty as asynchronous processing is handled by BinanceWebsocketClient.
"""

# Future implementation could include tasks like:
#
# 1. Periodic data aggregation:
#    - Calculate hourly/daily average prices
#    - Generate statistics reports
#
# 2. Database maintenance:
#    - Cleanup old price data beyond retention period
#    - Optimize database tables
#
# 3. User notifications:
#    - Alert users when price reaches threshold
#    - Send regular report summaries
